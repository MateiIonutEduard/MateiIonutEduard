# 👋 Hello, I’m Matei Ionuț-Eduard
I’m a **cryptography researcher** specializing in **elliptic curve–based cryptography** and **advanced isogeny studies**.  
My academic interests also extend into other areas of **information theory**, such as **data compression** and efficient<br/> information representation.
<br/>

### 🔬 Research Focus

My primary focus lies in understanding and improving the mathematical structures underlying elliptic curve cryptography,<br/> particularly through **isogeny-based constructions**. I enjoy exploring both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography, <br/>always seeking new connections between pure mathematics and real-world systems.

### 💻 Software Engineering Experience

Alongside my academic work, I have worked in several **software development companies**, contributing to the creation of **web applications**, **tools**, and **game projects**. I have hands-on experience with both **backend** and **frontend** technologies, and have developed projects using<br/> **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

# 👋 Hello, I’m Matei Ionuț-Eduard
I’m a **cryptography researcher** specializing in **elliptic curve–based cryptography** and **advanced isogeny studies**.  
My academic interests also extend into other areas of **information theory**, such as **data compression** and efficient<br/> information representation.
<br/>

### 🔬 Research Focus

My primary focus lies in understanding and improving the mathematical structures underlying elliptic curve cryptography,<br/> particularly through **isogeny-based constructions**. I enjoy exploring both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography, <br/>always seeking new connections between pure mathematics and real-world systems.

### 💻 Software Engineering Experience

Alongside my academic work, I have worked in several **software development companies**, contributing to the creation of **web applications**, **tools**, and **game projects**. I have hands-on experience with both **backend** and **frontend** technologies, and have<br/> developed projects using **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

I primarily use:
- **C#.NET**
- **C/C++**
- **Rust**
- **Go (Golang)**
- **Python**
- **TypeScript**
- **JavaScript**

I value clean, maintainable code and enjoy experimenting with new technologies that balance performance and clarity.<br/>

### 🤝 Collaboration Interests

I’m particularly interested in collaborations involving:
- Practical, high-impact software tools (CLI, desktop, or web)
- Innovative or educational applications in computer science
- Cryptography research

Whether academic or industry-related, I enjoy contributing to projects that have real-world value.<br/>

### 🌍 Open Source

I’m open to contributing to or co-developing **open-source projects** that are both technically challenging and intellectually <br/>rewarding. If you’re working on something exciting in cryptography, systems design, or developer tooling, I’d love to connect.

### 🙏 Thank You

Thank you sincerely for visiting my profile and taking the time to read about my work and interests.  
Feel free to reach out for collaboration or just to discuss cryptography, math, or software engineering!<br/><br/>

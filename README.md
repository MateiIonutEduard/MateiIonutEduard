# 👋 Hello, I’m Matei Ionuț-Eduard
I’m a **cryptography researcher** specializing in **elliptic curve–based cryptography** and **advanced isogeny studies**.  
My academic interests also extend into other areas of **information theory**, such as **data compression** and efficient<br/> information representation.
<br/>

### 🔬 Research Focus

My primary focus lies in understanding and improving the mathematical structures underlying elliptic curve cryptography,<br/> particularly through **isogeny-based constructions**. I enjoy exploring both theoretical and applied aspects of cryptography, <br/>always seeking new connections between pure mathematics and real-world systems.

### 💻 Software Engineering Experience

Alongside my academic work, I have worked in several **software development companies**, contributing to the creation of **web applications**, **tools**, and **game projects**. I have hands-on experience with both **backend** and **frontend** technologies, and have<br/> developed projects using **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

I primarily use:
- **C#.NET**
- **Rust**
- **Go (Golang)**
- **Python**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**

I value clean, maintainable code and enjoy experimenting with new technologies that balance performance and clarity.<br/>

### 🤝 Collaboration Interests

I’m particularly interested in collaborations involving:
- Practical, high-impact software tools (CLI, desktop, or web)
- Innovative or educational applications in computer science
- Cryptography research

Whether academic or industry-related, I enjoy contributing to projects that have real-world value.<br/>

### 🌍 Open Source

I’m open to contributing to or co-developing **open-source projects** that are both technically challenging and intellectually rewarding.  
If you’re working on something exciting in cryptography, systems design, or developer tooling, I’d love to connect.
